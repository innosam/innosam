Functional Programming

I have faced concurrency issue and understand thats its really hard to realize software that is parallel.

After listening to Martin Odersky talk on [Working Hard to Keep it Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jg1AheF4n0), it really inspired me to discover what lies beneath this functional programming paradigm. 

He points out:

1> Multicore is the trend going forward, and parallel programming is really hard. 
So there is need of way to write software such that it takes advantage of the multiple cores while also making the programming easier.

2> Shared mutable resource is root of the problem in achieving concurrency, the reason we need locks to protect shared resource.

3> Avoiding mutable state means programming functionally.

4> Functional programming is like building a Lego structure(sounds good) while beautifully making it parallel/concurrent.
